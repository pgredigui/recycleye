Developing a Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) plan can be challenging. A prerequisite for efficient MSW plan is the accurate measurement of the mass distribution per waste stream. 
Even though sampling and current models provide accurate mass measurements for long term estimation, they cannot be used for real-time predictions. Machine vision and machine learning,
 which are more and more extensively used for waste management, could provide the tools needed for continuous mass measurements. This study aims to determine how machine learning and computer 
vision can characterise the mass and the volume of waste in real-time. Two algorithms have been developed for this purpose. The first one used top views of objects captured with a depth camera 
to identify the main geometric properties. The 3D shape is then estimated, and, finally, related to the mass with the density. The second algorithm employed a neural network to detect brands on 
waste. The first algorithm has been able to measure the mass of newspapers, magazines and plastic PET bottles with an accuracy of  99.2\%, 86.5\% and 99.1\%, respectively. The second one 
identified the brand on waste produced by Coca-cola, Heineken and Pepsi with a 93\% accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning is suitable for real-time mass measurements on waste. 
The brand can be used with the volume to identify products which would increase the granularity of the waste characterisation and provide even more information to improve mass measurement.
This technology may provide to policymakers the information needed to develop MSW plan with a much more refined spatial and temporal scale.
